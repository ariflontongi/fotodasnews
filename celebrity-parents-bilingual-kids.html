It requires exposing your child repeatedly to the new language, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>Linguistic Society of America</span></a>. And there are all sorts of strategies to do just that. Some parents swear by <a href=#><span class=s2>not allowing their kids to speak English at home,</span></a> while others also <a href=#><span class=s1>enroll their kids in language courses</span></a> or stock the family library with <a href=#><span class=s2>child-friendly books written in the other language.</span></a></p><p class=p1>The effort can be worth it, as there are <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>plenty of benefits</span></a> to being bilingual. It can help boost <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>empathy</span></a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>reading skills</span></a> and the ability to multitask, to name just a few.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And then there are the more personal reasons a celebrity parent may want their kids to master another language. Eva Mendes, for example, teaches her kids Spanish as a way to <span class=s2>maintain a link to her family’s Cuban roots</span>, while Camila Alves and Matthew McConaughey make sure their three children can speak Portuguese so they’re able to communicate with her family in Brazil.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>No matter what language their children are learning—or how they’re going about teaching it—we love seeing the way celebrity parents are broadening their kids’ horizons.
