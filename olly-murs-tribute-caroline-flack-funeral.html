Thejudge confessed he "felt numb" when his manager told him the sad news during his holiday abroad. Due to the time difference, Olly found out the news in the middle of the night. "My phone went at 2.23am and I'll never forget it," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>the Sun</a>. "My manager told me and I just stared at my phone for hours, I didn't know what to do. I just didn't want to believe it. I was numb to any feelings and then I just broke down." He continued: “I'm still in shock, really. To think I won't have a conversation, a laugh, work, or even just get a random voice note from Cazza again - I just can't get my head around it," he explained, adding: "Since then I just have constant waves of emotions - one minute I'm ok, the next I'm so sad for her. It's hard, I'll always miss Caz a lot."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
