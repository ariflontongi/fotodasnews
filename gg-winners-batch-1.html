Her voice and demeanor were well-practiced, believable and, as a result, Globe-worthy.<br><b>Signature Style</b> You could call her a conservative risk-taker on the red carpet. Her choices are always unique, not usually in sync with the trend du jour, but always stunning. She tends to veer toward metallics or basic, albeit strong, black.<br><b>This Look</b> Giorgio Armani, a favorite designer of the Aussie actress, calls her "serene, confident and elegant."

She has said, "I love to see other people looking beautiful, but I'm not someone who likes dressing up." While her style at the time was very '60s mod, these days it's not as easily defined. Sometimes she dabbles in colorful combinations; sometimes she opts for basic black.<br><b>This Look</b> For the New York premiere of Away From Her, Christie offered a little nod to her mod phase with black tights under her green dress.

"Black is me-and it's easy since I don't have time to put that much thought into clothes," says Jolie.
