Doing the same thing over and over, as Vaas, is the definition of insanity, and that pitch alone makes the Far Cry 6 DLC enticing. Playing it, on the other hand, is unreal.<h2>Who will you play as in Far Cry 6?</h2>You play as Dani Rojas, a guerilla fighter, in Far Cry 6.<h2>Who is the true villain in Far Cry 3?</h2>Hoyt Volker is the main antagonist of Far Cry 3. He is described as "armageddon" compared to Vaas Montenegro and is a drug kingpin and brutal human trafficker.<h2>Is Diego Vaas?</h2>The post-credits scene and the events of Far Cry 6 make it definitively clear that Vaas and Diego are not the same person.<h2>Who is the best Far Cry villain?</h2>Vaas brought a radically charismatic and unpredictable violence to the story that made him the star of any scene he appeared in.

Anton's death was very much a consequence of his own actions and decisions, whereas Diego was nothing but a tool for his father. Unfortunately, there is also nothing players can do to help save Diego from his death.<h2>Is Anton Castillo a psychopath?</h2>Anton's personality is a very different take on a psychopathic villain, and it is one that is unfortunately not as successful as Vaas' unhinged mania. Throughout Far Cry 6, most of the scenes that players see him in revolve around him trying to groom his son Diego to take his place.<h2>Is Vaas a good guy?</h2>Vaas Montenegro was once what appeared to be a "good guy".
