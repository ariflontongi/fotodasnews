In some cases the male will have larger paddle-like pectoral fins and a bulkier dorsal muscle.

If a female does spawn in an aquarium setting, there is an excellent chance that the eggs will not be fertilized and that she or her male counterparts will eat the eggs before they hatch. Virtually all clown loaches sold for aquaria are captured in the wild. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on thesprucepets.com</a><h2>Do Kuhli loaches like sand or gravel?</h2>There are no fresh water fish that I know of that will clean sand or any other substrate. But Kuhli and many other loach species prefer soft sand because they either rummage in it for food, burrow in it or huddle under things on top of it. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What is the lifespan of a Kuhli loach?</h2>Kuhli loaches reach maturity at 2 3⁄4 inches (7 cm) and have a maximum length of 4 inches (10 cm).

Some sources even say they have to be over 2 years old before they are ready to breed for the first time. They spawn as pairs, but it's best to get a group of adults, and let them pair off and select their own mate. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on be.chewy.com</a><h2>How do you breed coolie loaches?</h2>Breeding the Coolie Loach<p>The breeding tank should have low water levels, very dim lighting, and floating plants, which will be used by the female when laying her eggs.

At night, however, you shouldn't be surprised to find them exploring their habitat. They're most likely to exhibit confident and curious behavior if kept with peaceful species that occupy the middle to upper levels of the tank. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on shrimpybusiness.com</a><h2>Do kuhli loaches need sand?</h2>Substrate: If you are planning on plants, sand might not be the best choice, as gravel provides much more nutriets, but then again, kuhli loaches love sand to bury in. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on forum.aquariumcoop.com</a><h2>Will kuhli loach eat flakes?</h2>Loaches fare very well in most community aquaria.
