While driving on the Mall, they were stopped and the would-be kidnapper, Ian Ball, began firing a gun. Anne's personal police officer James Beaton, her chauffeur Alex Callender and a nearby journalist Brian McConnell all attempted to intervene and were shot.<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;A passing former boxer, Ron Russell</a>, was able to hit Ball and help Anne from the scene before another officer was shot upon arriving to help.

Speaking about the situation, James reflected: "I had nothing… There was no back-up vehicle. The training was non-existent; but then again, [we thought] nothing was going to happen. They are highly specialised now, highly trained."</p><h2><strong>The Queen&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=emoQtTj7IwEz data-wc=73>A man named Christopher John Lewis tried to kill<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;the late Queen</a> in 1981 in New Zealand. Hiding a gun, he fired through a window at the Queen, missing her. He was arrested eight days later with public possession of a firearm and public discharging of a firearm, which surprised him at the time, as he reportedly replied: "Only two charges, what? [Expletive] ... Had the bullet hit her, would it be treason?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/402f9236904a-queen-pink-outfit-z.jpg><p id=e2zjRjw85h64 data-wc=98>In another instance, a man named Jaswant Singh Chail admitted that he broke into the grounds of Windsor Castle with a crossbow in<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;the hopes of killing the Queen</a>. He was near her private apartments back in 2021 when he was apprehended, and he claimed to want revenge for the 1919 Amritsar massacre in India. He pleaded guilty to section two of the Treason Act as well as possession of an offensive weapon and making threats to kill. At the time, a royal protection officer questioned him, to which he replied: "I am here to kill the Queen."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2667523cf191-queen-australia-1981-z.jpg><h2>Prince George</h2><p id=eV-w-SUbaKDV data-wc=58>In 2018, a man named Husnain Rashid was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25 years for encouraging an attack on <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince George</a> using the messaging site Telegram.
