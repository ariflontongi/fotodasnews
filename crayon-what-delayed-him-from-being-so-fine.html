Personally, I was in love with his song, <strong>So Fine</strong>, which was his introductory song, and for some time, I wondered why Nigerians don’t relate to his sound compared to his counterparts.</p><p>Was <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> lacking the star power or charisma that could nationally blow an artist?</p><p>While looking for answers, my research showed he wasn’t signed directly to Mavins when he joined the Label. I discovered he was signed to <strong>Blowtime Entertainment</strong>, owned by Mavins record producer <strong>BabyFresh</strong>. As we all know, music needs sufficient funding and moves to go beyond doubts. I’ve seen the youngster as a potential artist, but he lacked a good push due to the record label’s capacity.</p><p>Boom, then come 2022 when <strong>Mavins</strong> signed him on a joint deal with <strong>Blowtime</strong>, which means his career would also be pushed under <strong>Mavins</strong>, just like <strong><a href=#>Rema</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Ruger</a></strong>’s <strong>Jonzing World</strong>/Mavins deal.</p><p>You might be wondering what caused the delay, I can’t possibly state what triggered the delay in the joint deal for all this while; it might have been a contract agreement, where everyone wants to have a good share of the goodies.</p><p>But then, they went into the deal, and <strong>Overdosing</strong>, originally owned by <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong>, which is one of his songs, was worked on to bring him out. <strong><a href=#>Magixx</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Ayra Starr</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Ladipoe</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Boy Spyce</a></strong> were all good picks for the features on the project.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, <strong>Mavins</strong> released it as a Mavin new anthem, and as we all know, none of their joint anthems has ever flopped.</p><p>The project did the drill, bringing out not just <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Magixx</a></strong>, and the likes of <strong><a href=#>Boy Spyce</a></strong>, who were still fresh, trying to find their stand in the industry.</p><p><strong>Overdose</strong> is a good strike, giving more exposure to <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Boy Spyce</a></strong> compared to others.</p><p>We can’t deny that Mavins is one of the Kings of this business. With no hesitation, they made sure <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> dropped a dope follow-up, which is <strong>Ijo LabaLaba</strong>, a project which was a good pick as a follow-up.</p><p>Making it a brace strike for the creative act, <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> this year as we wait for his hat trick. This is Mavins; this is what they do.</p><ul><li>My question is, do you think <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> has what it takes to maintain this lead?</li><li>Was his delivery on <strong>Overdose</strong> a top contender for the best verse in that song? If not, who held that song down for you?</li></ul><p>As we all know, <strong><a href=#>Crayon</a></strong> being able to maintain the lead would place him among the likes of <strong><a href=#>Ruger</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Buju BNXN</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Zinoleesky</a></strong>, etc., who happens to be somehow his sets.</p><h5>NOTICE!!
