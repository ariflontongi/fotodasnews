Despite the fact it’s taken me until almost 2024 to begin, I decided to try out microneedling.</p><p id=eGY5NYiVTtA data-wc=73>I’d heard about the celebrity-approved facial treatment used by the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Aniston,</a> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Victoria Beckham</a> and Kim Kardashian, and wondered if it was really worth the hype. Considering the hashtag #microneedling has over 1.7 billion views on TikTok, I realised that there are likely many people who were as curious as I about the procedure. So I visited <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Regents Park Aesthetics</a> clinic in Marylebone to see what the fuss was all about.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What is microneedling?</strong></h2><p id=ee98io8OP34 data-wc=49>Microneedling is a cosmetic treatment that uses tiny sterile needles to "generate new collagen and skin tissue to smooth, firm, and tone skin," according to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Healthline</a>. It’s a quick process and is minimally invasive, therefore the recovery is usually quick and painless (more on my experience with this below).</p><p id=eFcdvW0DJB data-wc=48>Jennifer Aniston summed it up perfectly in Leyman's terms in an interview with : “I do micro-needling! I just learned about it a couple months ago from a facialist in New York,” she said,“it allows the serums and whatever products you’re using to really soak in".</p><p id=ea3Jisx4G5k data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Try The Trend: TikTok's Hailey Bieber-approved fake freckle hack has me utterly hooked</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2 dir=ltr>How long does microneedling take?</h2><p id=eCPibReXce data-wc=36>The process took around 30 minutes overall, and the actual microneedling itself took around 10-15 minutes for my whole face. It's optional to have it alone, or it can be incorporated into a full facial experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=eS3nwPEPx9X data-wc=30>I had the latter, opting for Regents Park’s new ‘The Seoul Glow’ facial, which aims to help achieve ‘glass skin’, therefore my treatment lasted around an hour and 15 minutes.</p><p id=ex8PzNEejk data-wc=24>It’s important to note that the combination of treatments I had may also be responsible for the results I saw, not just microneedling alone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cfc67685fd9f-img3574.jpg><h3 dir=ltr><strong>The first steps</strong></h3><p id=eUrM8znu7wA data-wc=19>The aesthetician cleaned my face with a foam cleanser, then gave me a lymphatic draining massage with her hands.</p><p id=eIObngElK4X data-wc=29>This was followed by a HydraFacial, which uses a suction tool to penetrate deep into the skin and open pores for an intense cleanse and to extract impurities .</p><p id=escuaN-1ht9 data-wc=33>I then had a chemical peel, used to improve the skin's appearance from sun damage, fine lines, wrinkles and acne. The solution had a strong chlorine-like smell, but it wasn’t painful, just tingly.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>The microneedling procedure</strong></h3><p id=ezUIuNqcvuB data-wc=55>Then came the micro-needling. I was given the choice of whether to have anaesthetic cream applied to the face or not because it needs to be left on for 10/15 minutes before the process can begin, therefore can be sped up if in a hurry. I’d highly recommend the numbing cream for the first time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e78214abe322-img4138.png><p id=e2wzm6rnCh data-wc=55>The aesthetician then rolled the pen back and forth across my whole face. At the same time, the serum Jennifer Aniston was referring to was squirted onto the face, allowing full penetration of the vitamin cocktail via mesotherapy. I had Regent’s Park's new ‘Chanel Injection’ - a formula containing 55 ingredients to repair the skin.</p><p id=eFDNWXA6UR data-wc=30>It may be easier said than done as I don't have a needle phobia, but they really are microscopic, and are not visible to you when having the treatment done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c530c6dd98b1-img4133.png><p id=ef6jQEFn89 data-wc=20>Afterwards, a sheet face mask is applied along with ice cold cryo rollers across the face which is incredibly soothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d99786d0d812-img4136.png><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Is Microneedling painful?</strong></h2><p id=e3JBVx-jXi9 data-wc=54>I found it painless, but it depends on your pain threshold. With the anaesthetic, it just feels like little pricks on your skin. The practitioner left numbing cream off my chin to allow me to feel the difference, and personally, I’d have the cream on every time until my skin was used to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/666d475619f6-320533e6-c962-449a-b9dc-2f2320533885.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>The Verdict</h2><p id=etstAKsxiK data-wc=78>I admit, I was surprised to see how red my face was afterwards and it's impossible to avoid.<strong>&nbsp;(Top tip:</strong> learn from my mistake and do not have the treatment the same day as your friend's birthday supper). No makeup is allowed for at least 24 hours, and no skin peels/exfoliating for around five days. It's also imperative not to touch your face with unclean hands, as the pores are incredibly open allowing bacteria to build up easily.</p><p id=eNd_dagskeFV data-wc=72>I was just as surprised, however, to see the results of the process were immediate, and my skin looked more supple and hydrated than ever. The redness lasted around 24 hours and my skin was so clear. The pigmentation on my forehead was also significantly reduced. Personally, I think I noticed the effects of the microneedling more after one week, when my skin was still so radiant during my normal skincare routine.</p><p id=ejVr5g-iC8 data-wc=44>Though it's a pricey routine to sustain (a single full-face session at Regents Park starts from £250 and the aesthetician recommended I had the treatment once a quarter), I'd absolutely recommend having the treatment even once, to give your face a glow from within.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8GemK6sqWLBs7HNnapobWBpg3KEjqJkraqZmrFuucicqaimlZqxrbXNoGSfp6JiwamxjJ%2Bgq6ukYsGqucRmmKecXam1qr%2BMoqpmoJ%2BseqrAjLCcp6xf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./765386-iggy-azalea-playboi-carti-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Iggy Azalea &amp;amp; Playboi Carti: Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-finish-subway-tile-edges-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How To Finish Subway Tile Edges</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
