That's why the music video brings the song into light. Even in the making of the video, Katy Perry frequently mentions that there a lot of symbolisms in the music video, that you'd just have to catch them. She refers to the maze as "The Labyrinth of her Life" and "The Valley of the Shadow of Death". She also refers it to "The Labyrinth of her life last year that she didn't really talk about publicly". She refers to the little girl as her innocence. And notice that when the two walk down the hall of mirrors hand in hand, the little girl doesn't show up in the mirror, meaning she's not real. And another interesting thing is the two that's guarding the two Katy's from exiting to the light of the video. They are greek Minotaurs, otherwise known as half-man half-bull creatures. And let's not forget before the song even begins: that's cloud 9 that Katy's on. Also notice that the song is shown in private, and that the song is surrounded by her career, or her life. And the caterpillar in the beginning on the top of the entrance of the Labyrinth, and then Katy later receives a butterfly from her past self: not to mention that she wears a dress with butterflies in the hall of mirrors. That poison strawberry plays an important role as well before she is incapable in a wheel chair. Luckily her innocent self pushes through and she goes on. The prince is a liar, and Perry can see that now. The grass cat looks at Perry with her hypnotizing eyes. In the end, it's obvious Katy made a mistake and she opened her eyes to realize that mistake. Whatever it was, it had to do with her inner self. So that mistake in her inner self is resolved through her other side. Her past self. Her innocence. I think you can put the rest together. If you don't get it, just rewatch the video until then. I love this song because I can relate to it in full! (PS: The music video isn't exactly one of a kind, there's others that also feature a past self, mirrors, and a flurry of butterflies)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqSZpK56sbHRq7Bor5mZsm6t1pqing%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keira-knightley-first-appearance-pirates-of-the-caribbean-5.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keira Knightley hasn't aged a day in Pirates of the Caribbean 5</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kai-tennyson-nesiuss-obituary-cause-of-death-who-was-kai-tennyson-nesius-what-happened-to-kai-tennyson-nesius.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kai Tennyson Nesius's Obituary &amp;amp; Cause Of Death: Who Was Kai Tennyson Nesius?
