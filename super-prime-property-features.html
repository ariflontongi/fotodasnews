It's were we sleep, work, exercise, unwind, entertain and, sometimes, educate. While the Covid-19 vaccine marks the start of a gradual return to normalcy, the new features people desire are likely to remain.</p><p>See the 10 features that make a 'super-prime property' worth its eight digits below.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MStqKfJnSnyYthMdQtchxE-1920-80.jpg><p>Superlative size was one of the most frequent reasons cited on the survey of what contributed to a $10 million–plus sale. This includes a 10,000-plus square-foot home on 62 acres outside of Telluride and villas in Zurich and St. Croix.</p><ul><li><strong>See: </strong><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/president-obama-new-house-marthas-vineyard><strong>Obama house</strong></a><strong> – tour Barack and Michelle's new Martha's Vineyard home</strong></li></ul><h2 id=2-lots-of-land-2>2. Lots of land</h2><p>Many respondents to the survey, including those in Auckland, New Zealand, and New Delhi, cited 'large acreage' or 'sprawling retreat' as a key selling point for a US$10 million–plus property.</p><h2 id=3-proximity-to-natural-beauty-2>3. Proximity to natural beauty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/38U3wkEqJrzTLz7VFVDVvK-1920-80.jpg><p>Views are always in demand. But in the survey, both views and proximity to natural beauty factored into the equation, with respondents noting that closeness to parks, mountains, and beaches was often a major selling point</p><h2 id=4-defined-rooms-2>4. Defined rooms</h2><p>While open floor plans still sell, some agents have noted that separate spaces for cooking, dining, and working were preferred during this extended time at home. There has also been a return of the dining room, which many had begun to count out in favour of sprawling great rooms, that could inspire some sellers to carve out more distinct living spaces before listing.</p><h2 id=5-focus-on-health-and-wellness-2>5. Focus on health and wellness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apKAbjiH6d6BnZwUJ6YQpf-1920-80.jpg><p>Features that target emotional and spiritual wellness, such as spaces for meditation and massage and outdoor gardens and areas where homeowners can find a sense of calm, also improve a home’s value.</p><h2 id=6-privacy-and-security-2>6. Privacy and security</h2><p>Privacy and security frequently showed up as important factors in the survey. For instance, in Taiwan, a 'highly secured luxury apartment' recently sold for around US$10 million. Gated entry, privacy fences, or high-tech security systems are all ways to give a luxury home some added appeal.</p><h2 id=7-amenities-galore-2>7. Amenities galore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxoNQU6u3uyxv7qY7Mdp7d-1920-80.jpg><p>The decked-out home office, home gym, and pools are as in-demand as ever. But affluent buyers today also want a variety of recreation options, which might include a yoga studio, basketball or tennis court, and home theater. They want spacious entertainment areas to host their Covid-19 'bubble', and a kitchen that can produce restaurant-quality meals.</p><ul><li><strong>See: </strong><a href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/paul-simon-house-connecticut data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/spaces/house-styles-architectural-eras-224060><strong>Paul Simon's home</strong></a><strong> in Connecticut is on the market – take a tour of this elegant property</strong></li></ul><h2 id=8-sustainable-features-2>8. Sustainable features</h2><p>In some markets, especially those driven by the tech industry or with high levels of education, adding 'green' elements instantly boosted a home’s value and appeal. Buyers are looking for sustainable materials, such as bamboo, solar panels, geothermal heat, and greywater systems that divert some wastewater to watering the garden. Even simply adding an electric vehicle charging station may help get more eyes on a property.</p><h2 id=9-move-in-ready-2>9. Move-in ready</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRHbTTbvo7R9NRoMsfYdwg-1920-80.jpg><p>A near-universal trend among properties that sold for $10 million–plus was that they needed no updating. How do you get family members who have to work and learn from home out of the house so that renovations can be completed? Add to that the shortage of building materials and skilled workers, and a challenging process becomes impossible.</p><h2 id=10-outdoor-space-2>10. Outdoor space</h2><p>Outdoor space, even in luxury condominiums, is now essential, and many wealthy buyers want more of it. For instance, they may want to exercise outdoors, and also have a place for their kids to play and another to host guests and entertain. All outdoor space should be attractive and well-maintained.</p><p>Visit <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Sotheby's International Realty</a> to see a host of 'super-prime homes' for sale.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZqytoJq%2FbrzRoqSeZaCnvLGx0a2wZp6VlsG2vsSs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./831008-12-proper-names-nigerian-foods-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>12 proper names of some Nigerian foods you should know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-hgtvs-home-town-filmed-shows-location-explored.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where is HGTVs Home Town filmed?
