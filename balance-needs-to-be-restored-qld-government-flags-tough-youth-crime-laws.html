government announced tough new laws to combat contentious youth crime across the state.</p><p>The measures were previously ridiculed by the Labor state government as “unworkable” when introduced by the previous LNP government.</p><p>But a spate of recent high-profile deaths involving alleged youth offenders – including the alleged stabbing of Emma Lovell in North Lakes last year and the death of Toowoomba photographer Robert Brown – have prompted the policy backflip by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s government.</p><p>Ben Beaumont and Michelle Liddle – the parents of murdered teenager Angus Beaumont – were part of a small group of people who attended parliament to lobby for tougher laws to deal with young offenders.</p><p>“It’s not acceptable,” Ms Liddle said outside parliament on Tuesday.</p><p>“We think the balance needs to be restored and they need to take into account they are human lives, not statistics.”</p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119

2020.</p><p>They were joined by Brisbane woman Julie West, who started a petition after Ms Lovell died in an alleged home invasion on Boxing Day last year.</p><p>“We are taking new, tougher action to further protect the community and tackle the complex causes of youth crime,” Police Minister Mark Ryan told the chamber on Tuesday.</p><p>Under the legislative changes, which include some $332m of investments, a young offender who breaches bail conditions will be charged with an offence in Queensland.</p><p>The Youth Justice Act will also be amended to allow a declaration for “serious repeat offenders” to be made.</p><p>This means tougher sentencing principles will be applied against those particular youth offenders.</p><p>People who are passengers in stolen vehicles, commit burglary or enter a premise to commit an indictable offence will also have a presumption against bail.</p><p>“We have listened to the community. This action is all about putting community safety first,” Ms Palaszczuk said.</p><p>“We will use the full force of the law to target the small cohort of serious repeat offenders that currently pose a threat to community safety.”</p><p>Mr Ryan reiterated that a small cohort of “serious, repeat” young offenders were responsible for most of the youth crime in the state.</p><p>The previous LNP government, led by Campbell Newman, had previously amended legislation in 2014 to include breach of bail as a criminal offence for children.</p><p>This was attacked by Mr Ryan, who told parliament the changes did not result in any youth offender spending any additional time in detention.</p><p>“It was inefficient and poorly drafted,” he said.</p><p>Labor has clarified the changes it proposes to introduce will simply take existing breach of bail laws that currently apply to adults and extend it to young offenders.</p><p>As part of the reforms, $100m will go towards intensive case management programs across the Brisbane, Logan, Toowoomba, Moreton, Gold Coast, Rockhampton and Ipswich areas to target “chronic” offenders aged 13-17.</p><p>Another $17m will be allocated for youth justice workers to partner with police and $9m will be invested for assistance for victims of crime.</p><p><a class=body-link href=#>Just a few months ago Ms Palaszczuk announced major reforms to Queensland’s youth justice response</a> in the wake of Ms Lovell’s murder.</p><p>Those changes proposed sentences of up to 14 years for juveniles – with harsher penalties if they boast of their crimes on social media.</p><p>That sentence would increase to a more severe penalty of 14 years’ jail if the offence is committed at night and the offender is using or threatening violence; armed, or pretending to be armed; in company with others or threatens to damage property.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Brisbane data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Brisbane</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwvdSenKernJa7pXvCq6CmnV%2BXrq2tzZycZqaVmrG0edOoZJudXaeytMDOq5ydZaGhsW6zzq%2Bcq6admru1ecWlmKCrXam8trPHZrCoraSdeqS%2ByKacZqSRrMBwusSwqmarpKS%2FunvEnW1ta2dlrnl8xG2Zn2yTZrKlsMFsZ21tlJeycrDCbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachaels-new-stackable-food-containers-are-30-off-right-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachael's NEW Stackable Food Containers Are 30% Off Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1576127-pope-francis-africa-push-gender-marriages-s-a-special-case.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pope Francis Gives Up on Africa in Push for Same Gender Marriages: &amp;quot;It's a Special Case&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
