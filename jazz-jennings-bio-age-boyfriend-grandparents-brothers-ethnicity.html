Since then, Jazz has become a respectable figure within and outside the LGBT community.</span></p><p><span>Read Jennings’ story below, find out his biography and find out how everything that happened in his life came about.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jazz Jennings – Biography, Age,&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jazz Jennings was born on October 6, 2000, in South Florida, United States, to Greg Jennings and Jeanette Jennings.&nbsp;She was born male into a Jewish family.&nbsp;When he was born, Jazz was called Jaron (from Jordan and Aaron).&nbsp;When she was around 5 years old, she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and so she was identified as transgender from such a young age.&nbsp;Her family members, however, nurtured her in a gender-neutral way unlike the other children in the family, but as she got older, Jazz insisted that she be female.</span></p><p><span>At age six, she began making television appearances with her family where they talked about the challenges of growing up as transgender.&nbsp;The Jennings didn’t stop there, they went on to found the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation (in 2007), which serves the needs of young trans people.&nbsp;Jazz, meanwhile, founded a company in 2013 called Purple Rainbow Tails, which makes rubber mermaid tails.&nbsp;The proceeds from its sales are used to meet the needs of trans children.</span></p><p><span>In between setting up these institutions, she appeared in a 2011 documentary titled&nbsp;</span><span>I Am Jazz: A Family in Transition</span><span>&nbsp;that premiered on the Oprah Winfrey Network.&nbsp;Besides that, she has done several other commendable things during her speaking out on behalf of the LGBT community.&nbsp;Some of these include “I Am Jazz,” a children’s book she wrote detailing her life as a transgender child.&nbsp;The 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014” by Time Magazine.&nbsp;The list then included her memoir, “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teenage Girl,” as well as being on the TLC reality series&nbsp;</span><span>I Am Jazz</span><span>&nbsp;with her family.&nbsp;The fifth season of the series documents the events of the weeks leading up to Jazz Jennings’ surgery.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: grandparents, brothers</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jazz Jennings is not an only child.&nbsp;his siblings include an older sister named Ari and two older brothers, twins named Sander and Griffen.&nbsp;In addition to the love and support shown to her by her parents, Jazz is also pampered by her grandparents.&nbsp;Jack and Jackie.&nbsp;She is especially close to her grandmother who is aware of her love interests and romance.&nbsp;Her grandfather, on the other hand, is not entirely missing from the picture, it was he who encouraged her to undergo gender reassignment surgery and she completed it in 2018.</span></p><p><span>Sander and Griffen were introduced to audiences following Jennings family news in a 2011 documentary&nbsp;</span><span>I Am Jazz: A Family in Transition</span><span>.&nbsp;The twins like their big sister, parents and grandparents are also showing their support for Jazz and what she does for the LGBT community.&nbsp;As for their education, Sander is a pre-law student at the University of Florida.&nbsp;Like some young men his age, he is obsessed with American football, which he often tweets about.</span></p><p><strong><span>See also</span></strong><span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Who is Antonio Garza, is she trans, what is her gender, a boy or a girl?</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jazz Jennings might have been born in a fakebody, but she found a way around it just like she found a way to become confident in revealing her romantic feelings.&nbsp;Back in the interview with Barbara Walters, she let it be known that she had a thing for boys.</span></p><p><span>The media personality has a boyfriend who is a year older than she is;&nbsp;his name is Ahmir Steward.&nbsp;The duo reportedly met through email exchanges and when Jazz traveled to Philadelphia for a transgender health conference.&nbsp;For now, it’s a long distance relationship, but we haven’t seen any reason to worry about what will happen, as they seem ready to make it work.</span></p><p class=postsid
