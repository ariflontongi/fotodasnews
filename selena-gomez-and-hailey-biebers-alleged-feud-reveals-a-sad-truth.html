No one.</p><p>I won’t get too bogged down in the details but basically fans are accusing Hailey of making fun of Selena because she over laminated her eyebrows and relishing in the fact Selena was body-shamed over some photos of her in a bikini.</p><p>Selena, of course looked great in the swimsuit photos, but her figure was slightly fuller and the internet sucks … so, people cruelly called her fat.</p><p>It’s all pretty icky stuff and it has ended in Selena commenting on a TikTok that called Hailey a “mean girl” with the words “I love you”, and then announcing she was going to take a break from social media.</p><p>There’s also plenty of spicy details in this alleged feud.</p><p>Some fans are accusing Hailey of making a career out of copying Selena.</p><p>Hailey famously started a cooking show after Selena started one, and also got a G tattoo behind her ear, after Selena already had one in honour of her sister Gracie. No one is sure what Hailey’s ‘G’ stands for.</p><p>Plus, there’s been accusations that Hailey has a history of copying some of Selena’s most iconic fashion looks.</p><p>The pettiness is fun but it is hard to enjoy this feud because the crux of it seems to stem from two successful and gorgeous women fighting over a man wears sweatpants far too much.</p><p>Surely, both should have better things to do?</p><p>Look, nothing against Justin personally, but he is the same man that peed in a restaurant mop bucket in 2013 and he also tried to keep a monkey as a pet.</p><p>We aren’t talking about prince charming here! We are talking about a man that was arrested for drag racing and is famous for allegedly cheating on Selena.</p><p>Is he really worth feuding over?</p><p>No.</p><p>This isn’t <i>Twilight</i>.</p><p>It doesn’t really matter if you are team Hailey or team Selena – ultimately the only team that wins is team misogyny.</p><p>The team that likes watching women pull other women down.</p><p>If Hailey is taunting Selena online – then she needs to grow up, but why is Selena even bothering to respond to it?</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>It just plays into this whole idea that there are ‘mean girls’ and ‘nice girls’ and there isn’t much in-between.</p><p>It doesn’t matter which way you cut it, both women have become players in the sport that is demonising other women and for what?</p><p>Ultimately their feud just allows two successful women to be defined by one average man with floppy hair and the message that sends is beyond depressing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmpJmbsnCvxKWcm6qZqcZuvMeoq6irX6iyrbHNmmSgp52ax26tzZ1koZmZobK6ecGinJudoqh6orjLnp6enF2bsrawjKucr52RocBurYysmJ1lpKfCtbSOp5ywq12owbC%2B2GicnJmVm395rcRrnHJvZW59ebDCaWyfcWFrs6R8xJptaw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./soozie-tyrell-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Soozie Tyrell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gwen-stefani-re-creates-no-doubt-just-a-girl-outfit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>See Gwen Stefani Re-create Iconic Outfit from No Doubt Era</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
