In order to stay on top of dust and debris, I run my iRobot Roomba multiple times every week. The cover of the rug is removed and placed in the washing machine when you are ready to wash it.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In addition, what is the return policy for Wayfair.com?</h3><p>According to the Wayfair returns policy, if you are dissatisfied with your purchase, you can return it to them for a refund within 30 days of delivery, provided that it is in its original condition and packaging.</p><p></p><h3>Furthermore, how can I get my carpet back to you?</h3><p><b>Step-by-step instructions on how to pack a rug for return</b></p><p>In order to return an item, please contact us for a Return Authorization Number (RMA #) and return address.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Using twine, coil the rug from end to end, neatly into a tight roll and secure with a knot (do not apply tape to the rug).</p><p>Place the rug into the original packaging material, if it is still in good condition, and remove any existing shipping labels before placing it in the box.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to put my Ruggable in the dryer?</h3><p>Machine wash our standard woven covers on the permanent press setting or on a regular cycle with cold water using the permanent press setting.
