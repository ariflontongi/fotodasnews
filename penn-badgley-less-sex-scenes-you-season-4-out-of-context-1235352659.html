Shortly after, his comments led to online debate about onscreen sex scenes, with many questioning the idea that sex scenes somehow equated to cheating.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Fidelity in every relationship — and especially my marriage — is important to me,” the Gossip Girl alum said at the time, “and it just got to a point where I didn’t wanna do that.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a>, Badgley said that he was taken aback by the reaction to his comments, but he understands how things can be taken out of context on the internet.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“What I was speaking about wasn’t actually the final product,” he told the publication. “It was sort of like the culture inherent to the production of all movies but particularly those scenes. It’s like, look, we know that Hollywood has had a history of flagrant exploitation and abuse.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While Badgley knew he wanted to ask Gamble about reducing his sex scenes, he said he was still nervous to have the conversation with her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It was not easy. It was easy because of Sera’s response, and I felt relieved,” he explained. “But technically speaking, if I thought I’d had the ability to set that boundary earlier, I would have.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He also acknowledged that he’s aware that trying to steer clear of intimate scenes could have an impact on his career. “We shall see if setting that boundary, of course, has any ramifications,” he said. “Just simply, it does limit the number of projects you can be a part of.” But he takes comfort in knowing that his decision didn’t impact the writing of You or Joe Goldberg’s story.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It didn’t change the trajectory of the season at all,” he said. “I mean, Joe was naturally ready to not be in that position anymore.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the GQ interview, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Badgley also discussed season four</a>‘s two-part split and the finale, which included — spoiler alert! — Joe attempting to take his life as a way of saving Kate (Charlotte Ritchie) and the other people around him from himself.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actor said he thought Joe’s decision to jump off of a bridge in London was ironic in the sense that though it seems like he’s making a drastically different decision than he has throughout the show, he’s not really.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Joe is still following the logic that he’s always followed, which is, ‘I’m going to kill someone to save another,'” he said. “And the irony is that even in that act, he’s still self-centered.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He explained that the season was never meant to be released in two parts, saying he wasn’t sure what the conversations were surrounding that decision, but he didn’t mind it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I think that’s just Netflix’s economic reality,” he continued. “And I think it makes sense, generally, to release things in installments. I like that. When I found out, I was like, ‘We’re going to leave a month between [episodes] five and six? That’s a big old diversion.’ Because, to me, it doesn’t all come home until you finally see the cage.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">During a later appearance on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, Badgley explained that he took down the trailer for Part 2 after sharing it on social media because it spoiled Part 1. “Netflix knows what they’re doing, but it makes me nervous,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While stopping by The Hollywood Reporter’s TV’s Top 5 podcast, Gamble expanded on the decision to split the season into two parts, sharing that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>it came from the streamer</a>, which has been doing that with some of its shows — a prime example being <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Stranger Things season four</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They certainly didn’t force it on us,” she said. “They were just like, ‘We were thinking about this for your season, and we know you have this mystery structure, and do you feel like this would work?’ And it just so happened that the structure split cleanly down the center of the season, probably ’cause Greg Berlanti and I have written many a midseason cliffhanger for old-school television. I can’t help it. I need to, proverbially, burn something really big down in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode five of 10</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">You season four is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOqZynpl2XrqWzy56wZqSVqMBuv8SxZKyblaOytHnYqKxmq5WWwLC6jG1kqK2kYrynecKopa2dqKl6cn6SbmpuamZqhnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./psy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Psy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olly-murs-tribute-caroline-flack-funeral.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olly Murs pays heartbreaking tribute to Caroline Flack on the day of her funeral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
