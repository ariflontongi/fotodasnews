He honed his craft in promotions such as ROH and NJPW before starting AEW as one of the top stars during its initial year. He also took part in the infamous throne-breaking spot, and it seems he plans on talking to Triple H about it.</p><p>Cody Rhodes was very serious when it came to his war against WWE, which was evident in his destroying Triple H’s throne during AEW Double Or Nothing 2019. He took shots at Triple H in the past as well apart from that.</p><p>Despite this, Cody Rhodes has gone on record to say that Triple H is his favorite wrestler. In addition to that, Cody Rhodes made it clear that he does not regret taking shots at Triple H at all.</p><p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Jimmy Traina on the SI Media Podcast</a>, Cody Rhodes was asked whether or not he had spoken to Triple H about the broken throne. Cody Rhodes stated that he still has not talked to The Game about it but plans on doing so in the future.</p><p>“It’s not mentioned. I’d love it to be mentioned eventually because I still have my broken throne at the Nightmare Factory. I was in the warehouse the other day with WWE, and there is the ‘throne’ throne. Mine is a replica. There is some imagery, some iconography that could be utilized for a show potentially. I’d love for it to eventually be talked about.</p><p>One thing that was really nice, a conversation that him and I did have, and I didn’t share this until recently, was when I won the Ring of Honor World Championship, I hadn’t spoken to [Triple H] since I left, and I just got a one word text from him that said ‘congrats.’ This is a Ring of Honor show, ends at 1 AM, essentially. Working here, there are a bazillion shows and things you’re doing. I was glad, I found out later, he watched every bit of it. He kept tabs on me. He has his finger on the pulse of what the young fans and the young roster is in to.”</p><p>Cody Rhodes also doesn’t want&nbsp;<a href=#>Triple H to see his father Dusty Rhodes when Triple H looks at him</a>. We will have to wait and see whether Cody Rhodes will actually talk to Triple H about the spot.</p><p>What’s your take on what Cody Rhodes said? Did you like the broken throne spot?
