It was reported that he<a href=#> “burned” too many chances with the company.</a> That wasn’t the first time Riddle was fired from a job, because the UFC famously fired the fighter years ago.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News exclusively reported that </a>WWE had no plans to reunite Matt Riddle and Randy Orton upon The Viper’s return. That being said, it’s not even an option now that Riddle has been released from his contract.</p><p>In a recently resurfaced interview from around the time Matt Riddle was released from the UFC, Dana White appeared in an interview, and he had a lot to say. The UFC President tore into Matt Riddle, and his affinity of marijuana.</p><p>‘The reason he’s not in the UFC anymore is because he could not pass a drugs test.”</p><p>“You’re so weak-minded and so addicted to marijuana that you couldn’t stay off it enough to pass a drugs test three times a year, well guess what, dummy? They drug test in the real-world too. You think you can’t pass one three times a year. I wanna know where this rocket scientist is gonna make six-figures a year!”</p><p>“This is the guy, Matt Riddle, who did an interview and said ‘I smoke Marijuana, so I don’t beat my wife and children.'”</p><p>Marijuana has been proven to have numerous medical benefits, and Matt Riddle has spoken in the past about his advocacy. Those failed drug tests may have led to his UFC release, but it had nothing to do with why WWE cut him.</p><p>Matt Riddle’s release from WWE brought on another controversy, and it unfolded on X. <a href=#>His ex-girlfriend spoke out and said that she was elated</a> by the Original Bro’s firing. <a href=#>Riddle’s fiancé, Misha Montana, fired back to put his ex in her place.</a> Then his ex stated that his problems<a href=#> really started when he met his current Montana.</a></p><p>We’ll have to see where Matt Riddle shows up next. Marijuana smoking is much more accepted now than it was around a decade ago when Dana White made those comments. Still, you have to wonder if he feels the same way about the Original Bro.</p><p>You can check out the video below to hear Dana White unload on Matt Riddle. Until we hear from the King of Bros again, we will keep updating you on everything else in the pro wrestling world here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on what Dana White said about Matt Riddle?!
