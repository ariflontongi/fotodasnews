the second straight time in 15 months.</p><p class=align-left>Both teams last met at the 2019 AFCON championship, with the Desert Foxes going through with a late stunner from Riyad Mahrez.</p><p

class=align-left>Legit.ng takes a look at few players who failed to step up their game in the narrow defeat to Algeria at the Jacques Lemans Arena.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Paul Onuachu:</strong></p><p class=align-left>The 26-year-old striker led the attack for the Super Eagles and he failed to record a shot on target for the period he stayed on the pitch.</p><p class=align-left>Despite scoring seven goals in seven matches for his Belgian club Genk so far this campaign, the tall attacker has failed to replicate his form for the national team.</p><p class=align-left>Although it could be argued that the coach has not been playing to the forward's strength anytime he represents his fatherland.</p><p class=align-left><strong>William Troost-Ekong</strong></p><p class=align-left>The new Watford FC signing captained the team for the most part of the game but he was found wanting most of the time.</p><p class=align-left>His partner Leon Balogun did most of the dirty jobs every time the leader of the team was found wanting by the Algerian attackers.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Samuel Kalu</strong></p><p class=align-left>The Bordeaux winger failed to complete a single dribble almost all his stay on the pitch as they Algerian defence managed to keep him out of operating.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Alex Iwobi</strong></p><p class=align-left>The attacker is one of the most experienced players on the pitch for the Super Eagles but that did not count for anything from the Everton man.</p><p class=align-left>He was unable to inspire his teammates to find the back of the net despite playing the playmaker role for Rohr's team.</p><p class=align-left>Though he showed some flashes of brilliance none was purposeful in the eventuality as the Eagles succumbed to Algeria for the second straight time.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Tyronne Ebuehi</strong> returned to the national team for the first time in about two years or more having being shut out of the team owing to a long injury layoff.</p><p class=align-left>He played most part of the game too but it showed he has not really blended with the rest of the team.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that it was a fight to finish at the prestigious Jacques Lemans Arena Die Zeit in St. Veit, Austria as African champions Algeria defeated the Super Eagles of Nigeria in a friendly.</p><p class=align-left>Nigeria returned to international action since their 4-2 home win against Lesotho in November 2019 and Gernot Rohr’s side, having won their first two games in Group L, lead the group with six points.</p><p class=align-left>The game is part of two warm-up matches for the Eagles ahead
