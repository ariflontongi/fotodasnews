Most prominently he sees his mother and father smiling down at him and it is this that is 'nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire' of young Harry's heart.<h2>What does Ginny Weasley see in the Mirror of Erised?</h2>First for Ginny, here she is looking at her reflection: she sees an older version of herself, maybe 14 or 15 years old, dating Harry. Ginny from an early age showed love interest in Harry, and that's why her deepest desire would be him noticing and falling in love with her as well.<h2>What would Snape see in the Mirror of Erised?</h2>Severus Snape would see himself with Lily Evans in the Mirror of Erised.

The name "Erised" was "desire" spelled backwards, as if reflected in a mirror.<h2>What would Voldemort see in a Boggart?</h2>JKR: That was my conclusion, that he would see himself dead. A Boggart knows how to show their fear to a person: Molly Weasley, for example, sees death of her family members in OotP. I had that idea, that Voldemort was afraid to die most of all. You confirmed my opinion.<h2>What is Ginny Weasley's boggart?</h2>Ginny Weasley's boggart | Fandom. On Ginny's page, it says that her boggart is Voldemort.<h2>What is Lily Potter's boggart?</h2>Lily Evan's boggart was Professor McGonagall telling her that she had failed all her classes. She failed not being good enough to be a witch and loosing her new life. She feared being ordinary and loosing her new home.<h2>Why did Dumbledore see socks in the mirror?</h2>The idea being that Dumbledore is wise enough to know he cannot have his family back and has reconciled that, so the mirror instead shows him with warm socks.<h2>Why did Dumbledore see Grindelwald in the Mirror of Erised?</h2>Dumbledore sees Grindelwald, both as a young man and the older Dark Wizard, in the Mirror of Erised because he never stopped being in love with him and always hoped they could be together, which is why he was reluctant to fight him for years (he won't face him until 1945).<h2>What does the Mirror of Erised say backwards?</h2>The mirror's inscription ('erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi') must be read backwards to show its true purpose.<h2>What did Grindelwald see in the blood?</h2>The animal's blood spilled on the floor, and in its reflection, Grindelwald saw a vision of Newt Scamander and Theseus Scamander heading to Hogsmeade.<h2>What does McGonagall say to the first years?</h2>One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. 'Now, form a line,' Professor McGonagall told the first-years, 'and follow me. '<h2>What does Erised stra EHRU OYT Ube Cafru OYT on Wohsi mean?</h2>Harry Potter Harry Potter Erised Mirror<p>Carved along the top of the mirror is the engraving from the books and movies: "Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi."

Padma Patil: A giant cobra. Fred and George Weasley: Lord Voldemort.<h2>What was Luna Lovegood's Boggart?</h2>Luna's spent years being called loony and crazy, and has always been able to say that she's just sane as the next person. So maybe her greatest fear would be that deep down inside, she would be crazy. And that the things she thought she saw weren't real, that she was hallucinating.<h2>What is Bellatrix Lestrange Boggart?</h2>During a Defence Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts, a boggart reveals her greatest fear to be a vision of the cloth-wrapped baby sinking into the depths. Warner Bros.

We doubt he would have fought so hard to try and save her life. We also think that Voldemort would not have given her a choice and would have killed her on sight.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1llKSytHnHnqmmoZ%2Bjsm6%2FxJ5koqZdqbWmecyiqaunomK8p3nEq6CsnZQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./51508-what-is-redbull-sound-select-anyways-30-days-in-la-with-kweku-collins-pell-tory-lanez-and-more-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Redbull Sound Select Anyway? 30 Days In LA With Kweku Collins, Pell, Tory Lanez &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-62-linear-inches-mean.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What does 62 linear inches mean?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
