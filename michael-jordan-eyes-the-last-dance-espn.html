Given the length of time that Jordan's eyes have looked this way, jaundice has often been cited by fans (who are not, it should be noted, medical professionals) as the likeliest reason behind the yellow hue of Jordan's eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hzm3KUx7WYdXqEppSPXAE6-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86Qdtt3qbKWT7JtFwaw6DK-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hqbQQ6UoDc6kC55fJrpWfY-1920-80.jpg><p>Jaundice is generally a sign of something bigger going on; it can be caused by a range of problems, including hepatitis, liver damage, and bile duct issues. (It can also be caused by&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/jaundice-why-happens-adults referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>certain medications</a>.) Basically, jaundice occurs when your liver isn't able to do its job properly.</p><p>That said, it's telling that Jordan's eyes have looked like this for so many years. If your eyes signaled health issues and you were one of the most famous and iconic men alive (one can't imagine that Jordan has&nbsp;missed&nbsp;the speculation about his eyes), it would be hard&nbsp;to avoid getting it checked out for two whole decades. At the very least, you'd assume that Jordan has gone for regular check-ups with his doctors and they would have flagged it as a concern.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Jordan's personal trainer at the time, Tim Grover, noted that Jordan's commitment to the sport could be extreme: "Michael would shut down everything outside of basketball and just train. Three workouts a day: workout, golf break, workout, lunch, golf break, workout, dinner, bed. Every day."</p><p>Grover also said in 1996, "I don't monitor Michael's nutrition plan anywhere near as much as the younger players I consult. He's learned more each year what works for him, what gives him the most energy and stamina." He did note that Jordan tends to lose weight quickly because of a high metabolism, though, so he prescribed smaller meals eaten throughout the day.<br></p><p>Jordan has also spoken about his post-retirement passion for cigar-smoking and alcohol, both of which can impact the bodyâ€”including the eyes. In 2005 he said, "I'm stepping away from that public image, from that other self that's been around for so many years. These are the things that I enjoy. These are the passions that help me get from point A to point B. The relaxation that I get from it." He added, "I'm not endorsing anything, or telling kids they should pick up cigar smoking or drink beer. These are things that I enjoy. This is my passion. They are some of the things that I like to do." He also mentioned, "I'm at that stage where now I'm taking my life back from the public and doing the things that I enjoy doing."</p><p>Whatever the reason behind Jordan's yellowing eyes, he almost certainly knows about itâ€”the man has access to the best doctors and treatments on the planetâ€”and is choosing not to share his private medical information with his fans, which is very much his prerogative. Though, with&nbsp;The Last Dance&nbsp;coming to Netflix on July 19, perhaps more info may come to light.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/signup referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/signup data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>WATCH THE LAST GAME ON NETFLIX</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZY2eCd3yWbnBopZmYtaKxy2ahqKqUlrtusdieqmasmJp6ra3SrWSdmZ6Ysm6x0qmlaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-tamahori.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Movies directed by Lee Tamahori</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./605550-meet-diezanis-partner-crime-super-yacht-billion-dollar-wealth-photos-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Kola Aluko And His Array Of Expensive Properties</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
