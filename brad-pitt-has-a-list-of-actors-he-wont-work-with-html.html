As with any job, there are sure to be people that you love working with and some people you’d rather avoid. Aaron Taylor-Johnson recently confirmed that Pitt has his favorites. In an interview with Variety, Taylor-Johnson <a href=#>said</a> “You work with many actors and after a while, you start making notes, ‘I am definitely not working with this person ever again.’ Brad has this list too: the good list and the s*** list.”</p><p>When you’re an actor of Brad Pitt’s caliber, you can certainly afford to be choosy about your roles. Fortunately for him, he likely won’t be forced to work with any actors on his ‘s*** list’ ever again, since Pitt has the luxury to pick and choose the movies, he’s in. However, Pitt has his ‘good list’ as well, so hopefully, Pitt doesn’t have to work too hard to avoid the actors he doesn’t like. One person who is on his good list is Sandra Bullock, who is in two movies alongside Pitt this year. Pitt had a role in her action comedy The Lost City where Bullock starred alongside Channing Tatum. She also has a role in Pitt’s most recent film Bullet Train, which also stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who we’d have to imagine made the good list as well).</p><p>If Brad Pitt’s upcoming acting projects are anything to go by, his fellow long-time Hollywood leading man George Clooney is also on the good list. The two Oceans franchise leads will be co-starring in an <a href=#>untitled thriller</a> about two lone wolf fixers getting assigned to the same job. The movie will be written and directed by Jon Watts, who is taking a break from superhero movies after directing the MCU Spider-Man films, including the smash hit Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p><p>Before we see Brad Pitt and Clooney reunite, we’ll get to see Pitt in the upcoming <a href=#>Damien Chazelle</a> film Babylon. This will be Damien Chazelle’s first feature-length effort since 2018’s The First Man starring Ryan Gosling. There are a ton of stars in Babylon, so Pitt’s good list is probably getting quite long at this point. The film tells the story of Hollywood’s transition from silent films to talkies and boasts a star-studded cast list that includes Margot Robbie, Olive Wilde, Samara Weaving, Tobey Maguire, Jean Smart, Eric Roberts, Katherine Waterston, Phoebe Tonkins, and more. It’s expected to come out on January 6, 2023.</p><p>However, you won’t have to wait until the New Year to catch a new Brad Pitt performance. You can see him alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Joey King, Brian Tyree Henry, Andre Koji, Michael Shannon, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bad Bunny, Logan Lerman, Zazie Beetz, Karen Fukuhara, and many more in the assassin film Bullet Train. The kinetic thriller comes to us from David Leitch (John Wick, Atomic Blonde, <a href=#>Deadpool 2</a>) and follows five assassins on a bullet train finding out their missions all have something in common. The film is <a href=#>in theaters now</a>, so make sure to check it out if you want to see Brad Pitt and some of his fellow ‘good list’ co-stars in action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkqeupXnPoqutZZiWwG6tjKWgrKxdpLNurcKtpqurXZ2ybsPOp6tmr5%2BnuG7DyK2fZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1566976-breaking-president-tinubu-approves-appointment-immigration-comptroller-general.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BREAKING: President Tinubu Approves Appointment Of Immigration Comptroller-General</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amandla-stenberg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amandla Stenberg Fan Casting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
