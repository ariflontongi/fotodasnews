As Williams was being held up, Barnett came up and hit him with a helmet-to-helmet shot. He launched himself as the whistle sounded.&nbsp;</p><p>Barnett was flagged for unnecessary roughness on the play. This season, he’s the Eagles’ most penalized player. He’s been flagged five times and two of them have been unnecessary roughness calls. The other came in Week 2 against the Falcons when he blindside blocked an offensive lineman after an interception.&nbsp;</p><p>After the game last Thursday, Barnett told reporters he wasn’t trying to make dirty play and his coaches backed him up.&nbsp;</p><p>“Derek’s the type of guy who is going to play through the whistle,” Eagles DL coach Phillip Daniels said. “And I thought on that situation right there, that he was playing through the whistle. It’s hard to hear out there on that field sometimes. I just told him to be smart. At the same time, I don’t think he’s the kind of guy that goes out there to try to hurt anybody. He’s just doing his job and playing through the whistle.”</p><p>Luckily, Williams will be OK. He was taken off the field on a stretcher but is expected to make a full recovery. But this week he has been going through the concussion protocol and isn’t expected to play on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Williams was taken off the field on a stretcher, Barnett went up to him to apologize.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things the Eagles really love about Barnett is his motor and how he never gives up on a play or takes a play off. He’s always rallying to the football. Eagles defensive captain Malcolm Jenkins doesn’t want Barnett to lose that either.&nbsp;</p><p>“I tell him not to slow down,” Malcolm Jenkins said. “I think the one thing that makes Derek special is he plays every play with one speed and that’s full speed. That’s how you’re supposed to play the game. Some things happen in this game. It’s a violent sport. I just tell him don’t change anything about his game.”&nbsp;</p><p>But there has to be a fine line and he clearly crossed it when he hit Williams. And now his pockets are lighter because of it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Click here</a> to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
