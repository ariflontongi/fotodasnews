He was the opening act for Paul Anka and performed alongside other famous singers like Sammy Davis Jr., Wayne Newton, Dolly Parton, McGuire Sisters and Don Ho.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I have deep aloha for Uncle Danny Kaleikini,”</span> award-winning Maui singer Amy Hanaiali’i wrote in a Facebook post Friday. <span class=quotations>“He loved Hawai’i and his culture. Always a big smile and ready to sing. A Legend.”</span></p><p>Hanaiali’i shared a recent conversation with Kaleikini backstage in the dressing room of the Hawai’i Theatre.</p><p><span class=quotations>“He said baby girl where you touring next?”</span> she recalled. <span class=quotations>“I said come with me Uncle. He said Uncle tired I no like tour anymore. I said Uncle after all of the thousands of performances you’ve done in your life, rest. He smiled. I will miss you Uncle. Mr. Aloha.”</span></p><p>Born Oct. 10, 1937, Kaleikini was one of eight children raised on Hawaiian homestead land in Papakolea, according to the Consular Corps of Hawaii.</p><p>Kaleikini learned to sing and perform at jam sessions after a day of work shining shoes in Chinatown, his website says. He started his career at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and eventually landed a seven-day-a-week show at the Kahala Hilton.</p><p>Over his career, he performed in two motion pictures, graced the stage at New York’s Carnegie Hall and collected a slew of honors, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame and the TBS award at Tokyo’s International Song Festival.</p><p>In 1988, then-Gov. John Waihee proclaimed Kaleikini Hawaii’s <span class=quotations>“ambassador of aloha.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“Uncle Danny Kaleikini will forever be remembered as an ambassador of aloha,”</span> Gov. Josh Green said on his Facebook page Friday evening. <span class=quotations>“He had a unique way of uniting communities through song. Our state will deeply miss his larger-than-life personality and his magic. Jaime and I are grateful for his love, support and friendship over the years.”</span></p><p>Another elected official, Central Maui Sen. Gil Keith-Agaran, shared memories of watching Kaleikini on TV growing up.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Sorry to hear about the passing of Danny Kaleikini — growing up on Maui, he was a weekly television fixture growing up for me when he hosted the Danny Kaleikini Theater, introducing a movie each week,”</span> Keith-Agaran posted on Facebook alongside a photo of him and Kaleikini. <span class=quotations>“He visited my office at the State Capitol on Opening Day in 2015. Condolences to his ‘Ohana and friends.”</span></p><p>The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported that Kaleikini died in his sleep Friday morning at St. Francis Hospice in Nuuanu and is survived by his wife Jacqueline, daughter Leonn, sister Susan and grandson Nicholas, also a musician who performed alongside his grandfather. Kaleikini was predeceased by his son Danjacques in 1992.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX6SaGdqZ5Gir6K%2F0pqbqKpdpLNurcuon5pllJa7r8WMpJilnZmgtq%2B1jJ2gnqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./annie-andersen-net-worth-127605.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Annie Andersen Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nope-meaning-explained-references-easter-eggs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All of the References and Easter Eggs in Jordan Peele's 'Nope'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
