Gypsy (played by Joey King on the show) spent 20 years effectively held prisoner by her mother Dee Dee (Patricia Arquette), who subjected her daughter to unnecessary medical procedures and forced her to use a wheelchair, in what appears to have been a classic case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Ultimately, Gypsy enlisted her boyfriend, Godejohn, to kill Dee Dee. As you watch the series (which just aired its finale yesterday), here's what you need to know about Godejohn.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>He had a criminal record before the murder.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2013, Godejohn <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fox6now.com/2015/06/16/couple-arrested-in-big-bend-now-charged-in-murder-of-missouri-woman/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pleaded no contest" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">pleaded no contest</a> to disorderly conduct, after police arrested him for allegedly viewing pornography on his laptop at a McDonald’s and touching himself inappropriately. When he met Gypsy on a Christian dating website om 2012, Godejohn was living with his family in Big Bend, Wisconsin. Little else is known about him prior to meeting Gypsy, although news reports indicate he had been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/crime/2019/02/22/nicholas-godejohn-sentenced-life-prison-blanchard-murder/2949249002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diagnosed with autism" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">diagnosed with autism</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>He and Gypsy had a secret online relationship for over two years.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BuzzFeed class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">BuzzFeed</a>, Gypsy told her neighbor Aleah Woodmansee in 2014 that she and Godejohn had discussed eloping, and were making plans for a future together. Gypsy also detailed her online sex life with Nick, which involved elements of BDSM and role play:</p>Godejohn referred to his “evil side” because he and Gypsy had constructed an elaborate online fantasy life, mostly through a jigsaw puzzle of Facebook accounts. They were into BDSM imagery. They had specific names and roles for each other. They took pictures of themselves in costumes, Gypsy dressing up at one point as the comic book character Harley Quinn, posing with a knife. Reality and fantasy blended quite a lot, for both of them.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She was talking about this new guy that she was now in love with, and that they had met on a Christian dating site and that they were already planning on naming their children after him,” Woodmansee told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ABC News" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ABC News</a>. “Honestly, what I was thinking whenever I saw these messages, is that these were just like fantasies and dreams and nothing like this would ever really take place.”</p><p><h2 class="css-1w9kuwj e1bddzxd0">The Act</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Watch Now for The Act" data-href=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-product-url=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/a4Js/hulu-two-wolverines","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Now" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-vars-ga-product-brand=lu data-vars-ga-product-id=4279b6c9-bcee-4ded-b026-5546d4b5de60 data-vars-ga-product-price=$13.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d4dff7d0-a806-47b3-9044-847b7fcb15e7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=lu data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"><img alt="The Act" title="The Act" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1556824751-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d.jpg width=400 height=600 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>Gypsy lost her virginity to him in a movie theater bathroom.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This particularly extraordinary moment from The Act’s fifth episode is played out just how it happened in real life. In March 2015, Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee attended a screening of Disney’s Cinderella (their shared love of Disney movies was well-documented; Dee Dee regularly took Gypsy to conventions in Disney costumes). According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/15/gypsy-blanchard-testifies-godejohns-murder-trial/2010754002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gypsy's testimony" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Gypsy's testimony</a> at Godejohn's 2018 trial, Gypsy hoped that by engineering a seemingly chance encounter with Godejohn in public, she could create a situation where Dee Dee might warm to him. Godejohn traveled all the way from Big Bend, Wisconsin to Springfield, Missouri to make this "chance encounter" happen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, things dd not go entirely to plan. “[Dee Dee] got jealous, because I was spending a little too much attention on him, and she had ordered me to stay away from him," Gypsy told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ABC News" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ABC News</a>.

Once the text came, he went to the Blanchard house, where Gypsy gave him the murder weapon (a knife) along with gloves and duct tape. Gypsy testified that she hid in the bathroom with her hands over her ears while Godejohn stabbed her mother to death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I honestly thought he would end up not doing it,” Gypsy told 20/20. “She called out to my name about three or four times, and at that point, I wanted to go help her so bad, but I was so afraid to get up. It's like my body wouldn't move. Then everything just went quiet.” After the murder, the couple took a taxi back to Godejohn's motel, and later traveled to Godejohn's family's house in Wisconsin, where they were arrested days later when police <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="raided the home" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">raided the home</a>.</p><img alt="Bonnie & Clyde" title="Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde" width=8256 height=5504 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/act-107-bh-0588rt-f-1556825048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hulu/Brownie Harris</span><p>Calum Worthy as Nicholas Godejohn in The Act.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>Godejohn says he felt remorse after the murder.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As BuzzFeed's story notes, Godejohn had no history of violence before he murdered Dee Dee. “I felt horrible about it," Godejohn told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=20/20 class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">20/20</a>. "When me and her were in the hotel room … she kept on telling me, 'Stop crying, stop crying. There's no reason, reason to cry. It was my idea, it wasn't yours." He added that he went along with the plan solely because he wanted to protect Gypsy. “I … did what I did because I loved her. I really wanted a life with her, I really did,” Godejohn said.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>He is serving a life sentence.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Godejohn <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/15/gypsy-blanchard-testifies-godejohns-murder-trial/2010754002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="was found guilty " class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">was found guilty </a>of first-degree murder after a four day trial last year. In February, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gypsy, who was sentenced to ten years in prison for second-degree murder in 2016, has distanced herself from Godejohn since their arrest. “There's a big difference between someone who asks someone to kill someone and someone that actually does it,” she told 20/20. “Because I would never kill somebody. I would never physically go through with killing somebody. I can't.” Of Godejohn, she said, "I don't hate him. I feel sorry for him, and just that somebody could do something so heartless and not express remorse and not feel like he's responsible for it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At his sentencing hearing, Godejohn reiterated that his motivation for the crime was his love for Gypsy. "I was blindly in love," Godejohn said. "That was always very much the case." In addition to a life sentence, he received a concurrent 25-year sentence on the charge of armed criminal action.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
