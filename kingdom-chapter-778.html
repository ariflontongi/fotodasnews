Shin was determined to avenge his master Ouki and his friend Kyoukai, who were both killed by Houken. Houken was driven by his obsession to prove himself as the strongest and the embodiment of martial might.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kingdom-Chapter-778-spoiler.jpg><p>The fight was intense and brutal, as both Shin and Houken unleashed their full power and skill. Shin was wounded and exhausted, but he refused to give up. He remembered the words of Ouki and Kyoukai, who encouraged him to surpass his limits and become a great general. He also felt the support of his comrades and allies, who cheered him on and prayed for his victory.</p><p>Houken was also pushed to the edge, as he realized that Shin was not an ordinary human, but a monster who could rival him. He wondered why Shin was so strong, and what was the source of his strength. He also felt the pressure of Ousen and Riboku, who were watching the fight and expecting different outcomes.</p><p>The final clash came when Shin and Houken charged at each other with their glaives. Shin managed to strike Houken’s chest, while Houken slashed Shin’s arm. Houken fell to the ground, mortally wounded, while Shin stood up, victorious. Shin declared that he had finally defeated Houken, and that he had done it for Ouki, Kyoukai, and all the people who died because of him.</p><p>Shin then collapsed, losing consciousness. His men rushed to his side, and carried him to a safe place. They celebrated Shin’s triumph, and hoped that he would recover soon. Ousen and Riboku also acknowledged Shin’s feat, and realized that the war was over. Ousen declared that Qin had won, and that Zhao had lost. Riboku admitted his defeat, and lamented his failure to protect Zhao.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_to_Read_Kingdom_Chapter_778></span><strong>Where to Read Kingdom Chapter 778?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can read Kingdom Chapter 778 online on the official website of Weekly Young Jump, which is the magazine that publishes the manga.
