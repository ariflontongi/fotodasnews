Moreover, he unveiled a new hairstyle to paparazzi following him around: a cross shaved on the back of his head. Of course, this is unsurprising from an artist that has been very vocal about their Christian faith and that plays with its imagery quite often. As small as the change may be, it's another minimal piece of context that fans harped on to get context around his mind state. After all, following his bigoted rhetoric and slammed attacks online, it's tough for them to connect with him in any meaningful way.</p><p>However, that can only be a good thing as Kanye West continues to reflect, heal, and stay out of the limelight. The damage brought about by his incendiary comments stretch far beyond any musical or artistic connection his audience may have formed. Still, things don't look necessarily promising as of late. For example, his <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> Season 10 fashion show reportedly had <a href=# rel>various references to Nazi and other right-wing imagery</a>. With that in mind, it's probably not yet time for him to return to the public space after undergoing a significant change of heart and attitude.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Kanye West Net Worth 2023: What Is Ye Worth?</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-west-s-new-do>Kanye West's New 'Do</h2></span><p>Regardless, that's not going to slow the Chicago rapper and designer down, or at least that's what recent reports indicate. Given that he recently filed a trademark for "<a href=# rel>YZY Sock Shoes</a>," many believe that he's breaking into the fashion space again instead of the musical realm. Despite those findings, it's unclear whether it will actually result in a sold product or if it's just another one of his ephemeral ideas. Only time will tell, although maybe he wants to stay low-key and reach more niche and blindly supportive audiences with his work. Another important component is <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Adidas</a>' decision to <a href=# rel>sell its Yeezy stock</a>, an agreement that, if successful, would net Kanye West a lot of money.</p><p>Meanwhile, other roadblocks exist on the 45-year-old's path that seem far more serious than his fashion endeavors. One of those is his chaotic presidential campaign, which might involve <a href=# rel>secret funds from conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene's campaign</a> and that's gone through a lot of <a href=# rel>staff changes</a>. His Donda Academy is also in <a href=# rel>dire straits</a> as teachers, parents, and the wider public seek another way forward. We'll see how important that cross is to his public image in the future.
