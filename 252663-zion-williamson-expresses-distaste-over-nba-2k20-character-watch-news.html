Williamson was dominant while playing for the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Duke</a> Blue Devils and was able to make himself the number one overall pick in this year's entry draft.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">There are a ton of expectations being thrust upon Zion</a> and people aren't exactly sure it's fair. Nonetheless, Zion is ready to prove all of his doubters wrong and during New Orleans Pelicans media day, Williamson spoke about what's been bothering him the most heading into the season.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As he explains, he feels as though his NBA 2k20 character simply isn't good enough and has some traits he would like to have improved upon. For instance, he wishes his character had a lot more speed. If you were a Duke fan this season, you were probably wishing the same thing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite the issues he has with his character, Zion seems to be happy about being in the game in any capacity. In the video above, Zion talks about how he used to always play 2K as a kid and to be able to be in the game is a special feeling.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If he has himself a good season, perhaps he will be able to up his rating and get those speed sliders up.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
