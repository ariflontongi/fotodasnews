Let’s get that straight here. Now,&nbsp;it was awesome. Awesome. I’m very blessed that in this life time, that in our youth we were able to come together in this day and age. You know that Africa is the next leader of the world. That’s been proven, it’s a fact. And so it is the right time. We are blessed that she did a phenomenal job by taking our industry to a whole new level. And this is what made me become a part of the production.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Why Genevieve's Bathroom Scene Was A Great PR Stunt</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p>Watch Legit.ng exclusive interview with Oris Erhuero (the article continues below):</p><p></p><p><strong>Given how much you have said about the movie industry in Nigerian are you looking to handle any more acting projects</strong>?</p><p><i>Well, it has to be from her though. Okay, I’m saying that the movie has to be that type of quality. You know, Genevieve really stepped up on this movie and only a few people around can get it. She is seasoned and ready to rival the world. Literally.</i></p><p><strong>Genevieve has been likened to Julia Roberts a number of times, what do you make of that?</strong></p><p><i>You know what? No disrespect but, Nigeria is in a class by itself. And I mean, no disrespect but who is that?</i></p><p><strong>How would you rate Road To Yesterday on a scale of one to 10?</strong></p><p><i>Can I get to a 100? Is that too small? Oh well, I’d say it’s above 10&nbsp;because&nbsp;I can’t rate it like that. It’s beyond, it’s not one of those movies you would rate. It’s epic. It’s historic. And I mean this because&nbsp;I’ve been in the game for a very long time so I can say this. You know I’ve been doing this for a while and at a point I just thought I wasn’t going to enjoy acting anymore. But with this new movie I will say ten on a scale of one to ten.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt69otopuhfgv.jpg><p><strong>What should fans look to get once the movie hits the cinemas?</strong></p><p><i>They’re gonna get their money’s worth and I suggest they be on the lookout for many more movies from her company because I think Nollywood has taken African cinema to a whole new level. And I’m excited. I just can’t wait to stand back and watch all these materials come out. I think that would bring me the utmost joy.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Genevieve Nnaji In Steamy Bathroom Scene With Oris Erhuero (PICTURED)</p><p><i>If you’ve been observing you’d see how much the trailer has done outside our shores. And when I say outside I mean the guys in Russia, Poland, and all sorts of places. These are just people from social media and they have been calling out asking for the movie to drop. And I’ve never seen that sort of excitement from people outside the country in a while. And so I’m very certain the people will love the movie.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3V8kmtpZqqVlrFuusignKuhkWKupMDOq2SsmZmZeqixzZ6top2mmnqvusCjoGaalanBpr6Mo6yloZFiv7CuxKurrGaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./crystals-for-anxiety-wellbeing-tips-advice.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Follow Victoria Beckham's lead and find out how crystals can boost your wellbeing</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ed-sheeran-heartbreaking-family-death-amid-trial.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ed Sheeran suffers heartbreaking family death amid copyright trial</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./adam-yauch-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Yauch Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1222259-bankers-acceptance-characteristics-pros-cons-html.html>Bankers acceptance: characteristics, pros and cons</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./betty-brosmer-net-worth-130275.html>Betty Brosmer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1593363-big-achievement-katsina-state-governors-daughter-meenah-celebrates-university-graduation.html>Big Achievement: Katsina State Governor's Daughter, Meenah, Celebrates University Graduation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-chann.html>Chris Chann Biography, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe.
